# CrowdSim
A 2D **Black Friday** crowd simulation

---

This particular srowd simulation is based on **Agents** and **Individual Behaviour modelling**. This includes:
* Personality simulation
* Stress simulation

---

### Why Black Friday?

This is a perfect situation for chaotic but yet directed crowd movement. Each agent is trying to reach the target and *"purchase"* it by exiting the room with the product. The whole crowd is also under pressure by time limit until the *"shop"* closes, and also by the target distance to the exit. Both of which will result in *"mission failure"* if the agent fails to comply.

---

### Possible usage and applications

This system can be used for psychology and behaviour research, statistical analysis - all in scope of Black Friday situation or similar. The tool provides a set of controls to tailor the crowd to a certain requirement. It provides not complete, but a wide selection of personality parameters and a few basic controls for generation of the simulation area.

### Possible extensions

The simulation, if the stress and inter-agent fighting is removed, or changed to a value in a magnetic field, can be extended to simulate a ferromagnetic liquid. In this case, the *"product"* will become a **magnet**, and each agent will become a single particle of the ferromagnetic substance. This can be then used to render the resulting shape.
